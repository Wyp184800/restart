# restart
it is a mips processor which base on the book.

<font size = 32>PLEASE DO NOT LAUGH AT MY ENGLISH :( </font>

数据通路的实现完全参考（抄） 《自己动手写CPU》， 雷思磊 著， 电子工业出版社。
The realization of data flow all comes from <<Write a CPU by Yourself>> written by SiLei Lei, published by Publishing House of Electronics Industry.

我自己完成的部分（预计）包括：基数4除法，gshare或者其他形式的分支预测，2路组相联Cache，以及还没有明确方案的超标量和乱序执行。
the parts which I have finished or will finish include: radix-4 division, branch prediction in gshare or some other format, 2-way set associated Cache, and superscalar, OoOE without a clear blueprint.

我写完的部分并没有上传到github中，因为我不了解怎样正确的使用 分支，上一次我尝试在分支中提交代码时，整个仓库都乱了，这也是这个仓库命名为“重新开始”的原因，还望各位赐教。
something I finished did't have been upload to github, becasue I don't know how to use branch correctly.The whole repository crashed when I tried to commit my code to a branch in Oct. 2015. That's the reason why the name of this repository is "restart". I wish you could help me.
